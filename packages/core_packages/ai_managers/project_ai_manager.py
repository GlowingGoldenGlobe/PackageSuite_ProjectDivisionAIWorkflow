"""
ProjectAIManager - A specialized AI-driven project manager for GlowingGoldenGlobe modeling workflows.
This is not an AGI solution, but a narrow Small Language Model (SLM) or specialized AI module.

Responsibilities:
- schedule and track modeling-assessment (about humanoids's model parts and humanoid robots as full size) checkpoints (flag files, milestone markers)  
- define and store assessment criteria (geometry validity, physics test results, resource thresholds)
- evaluate assessment results and classify success/failure
- decide and emit next-step actions based on outcomes  
- monitor system and project resources and alert on limits  
- integrate with TaskManager for task creation and scheduling  
- request things from the user; such as to get user permission for committing additional responsibilities to self (to the "project AI manager") whenever self ascertains that self ought to take on an additional role in the project, or to make an additional "[N.] AI manager" instance for a new role in the project. Additional AI managers will force the project composition to be more specialized, and less reliant on a single AI manager about so many roles. When specific role needs to be modified and when many specialized AI managers are present, changing something about only one of many specialized AI managers will be easier than changing something about a single AI manager that is responsible for many roles, which would be more difficult to change as it might disrupt to many roles at once whereas many activities will be working simultaneously; then only one manager going wrong about an isolated role or set of limited roles will be easier to fix than one mananger wrong about everything. Smaller problems are easier to fix than larger problems. Simpler problems are easier to fix than more complex problems. Specialization makes the project accountable, verifiable and safe to use. Any problem can be isolated, and solved.
