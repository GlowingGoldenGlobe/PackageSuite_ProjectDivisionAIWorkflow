Parallel Task Example for AI_Agent_2 - Humanoid Torso Development

This script demonstrates a task that can be run in parallel by the Claude Parallel
execution system. It performs basic operations related to AI_Agent_2's responsibility
of humanoid torso development.

When run as part of a parallel execution:
1. The CPU and memory usage is monitored
2. Multiple instances can run simultaneously
3. Progress is reported back to the parallel execution system
